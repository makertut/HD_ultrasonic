NTRODUCTION
The XL-MaxSonar-AE0 offers a wide and sensitive beam pattern for indoor use. This makes the XL-MaxSonar-AE0 an excellent choice wherever wide beam detection, reliable people detection, or reliable small obstacle detection are required.

The sensor is small in size, yet the high output acoustic power combined with continuously variable gain, real-time background automatic calibration, real-time waveform signature analysis, and real-time noise rejection algorithms results in virtually noise free distance readings for most users. This holds true even in the presence of many of the various acoustic or electrical noise sources. The XL-MaxSonar-AE0 sensor line is factory calibrated to match the sensor beam patterns and provides a long range detection zone.
